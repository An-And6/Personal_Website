            <strong>Aspirations</strong>
            <p>
                When I graduate from highschool I would like to go into Sports Analytics. I have always 
                dreamed of working for a sports team but it is far too difficulte to become a coach. A 
                sports analytics job would combine my two greatest interests in this world, math and football.

            <strong>Interests & Hobbies</strong>
            <p>
                I love football. Every Sunday, I'm glued to my TV waiting for the Steelers to take the field. 
                I hope to work for the Steelers one day. I also adore movies. My two favorite directors are 
                Quentin Tarantino and Stanley Kubrick. Pulp Fiction and A Clockwork Orange are two of my 
                most favorite movies. My favorite movie is Slumdog Millionaire. I really like movies about my 
                home country of India and I thought this movie was fascinating.

                Over the years I have participated in many hobbies raging from sports to music. At a very young 
                age I began learning the game of chess. I love the strategy and planning involved in the game and
                it thought me the usefullness of critical thinking. During this same time period I began learning 
                two instruments, the piano and the veena. The veena is a string instrument from India. It is very 
                similar to the Sitar. I loved learning how to play songs from my native country but I would say that 
                I loved the piano even more. The piano made me fall in love with classical music. I love playing 
                Sonatinas by Beethoven or Minuets by Motzart. I have a phenomenal piano teacher who has helped me 
                hone my skills. As part of I school program I began volunteering to help less fortunate kids. I like 
                helping people living in impoverished communites because it gives me a sense of satisfaction.
